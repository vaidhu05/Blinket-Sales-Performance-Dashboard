🚀 Created exciting Power BI project where I built a sales analytics dashboard for Blinkit—India’s favorite last-minute grocery app! 🛒📊
Inspired by a detailed YouTube tutorial, I created a dynamic and interactive dashboard that delivers data-driven insights across multiple business dimensions. The project sharpened my technical and business storytelling skills through:
✅ Power Query for data cleaning
✅ DAX for key metric calculations (Sales, Ratings, Item Counts)
✅ Brand-aligned dashboard design (Blinkit’s yellow-green theme!)
✅ Interactive filters for Outlet Type, Size, Location & Product Categories
🔧 Key Insights Delivered:
Total Sales: $1.2M
Tier-wise outlet performance
Category-wise sales contribution
KPI-driven decision support visuals
🎯 Skills applied:
Power BI | DAX | Data Visualization | Dashboarding | Data Analysis | Business Intelligence

💭 Why Blinkit?
This project deepened my appreciation for how Blinkit blends speed, scale, and simplicity in retail. It would be a privilege to contribute to a data-driven brand that’s redefining hyperlocal delivery in India. 📦🔍
